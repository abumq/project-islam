You contribute in many ways, some of them are:
 - Providing authentic data
 - Testing the application as a user (Windows, Linux and Mac)
 - Write platform (Programming)
 - Write extension (Programming)
 - Write API documentation

If you wish to program, you must be able to write good C++ code that is efficient, memory friendly and easy to read. Every C++ code will go through code-review to ensure quality (readibility, memory efficient, fast algorithms)
