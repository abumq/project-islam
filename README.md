Project Islam Platform
----------------------

Extendable project for Islam

This project is still being developed and not ready for use just yet - but surely is at stage of continues regression testings. If you wish to contribute to this project please feel free to contact me and I will make arrangments accordingly.

#### Extensions Ready

(No extension available yet!)

#### Extensions Being Developed

 - Quran Memorization (Memorization)
 
     Since full API is not yet available, so developing of this extension is a bit slow. Once whole API is done for Quran reading, reciting, this extension should be available and platform's first version will insha'Allah be released.

#### Current Focus

 - Database Manager and builder is a big mess, needs to be standardize
 - Build database builder as separate Qt application and remove settings -> data -> rebuid data settings
 - Ability to download data (recitations, translations) from settings -> data tab (prototype since we dont have a server to keep media files just yet, we can use icplusplus.com server for prototyping)

#### Future plans (Platform)
 - Auto-update installed extensions
 - Downloadable data

#### Future plans (Extensions API)
 - Word-by-word data from corpus.quran.com (contact these guys to get permission)

#### Future plans (Extensions)
 - Athaan (Call for prayer)
 - Hadith collection

#### Contribute

You contribute in many ways, some of them are:
 - Providing authentic data
 - Testing the application as a user (Windows, Linux and Mac)
 - Write platform (Programming)
 - Write extension (Programming)
 - Write API documentation

If you wish to program, you must be able to write good C++ code that is efficient, memory friendly and easy to read. Every C++ code will go through code-review to ensure quality (readibility, memory efficient, fast algorithms) - 

Few notes on programming:
 - Use pointers over passing by references
